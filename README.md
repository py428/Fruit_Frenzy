This is a 2D game titled "Fruit Frenzy" using the OpenGL library in Python.
The objective of this project is to apply basic computer graphics techniques, particularly the Midpoint
Circle Drawing Algorithm, Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm and GL_POINTS primitive type, to create an
interactive game. The game challenges the player to collect falling fruits while avoiding bombs, managing
hearts (lives) and scoring points based on the variety of fruits caught.
